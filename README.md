# ArcDiagrammer
ArcDiagrammer for ESRI ArcGIS 10.x

I packed all the required libraries from ArcGIS 10.2 into ArcDiagrammer.

*Requirements:*
- A working a ArcGIS for Licensing (I tested only on ArcGIS 10.5 on Windows 10. It should work on any ArcGIS 10.x).
- .Net 3.5 (which should be already available from ArcGIS or Windows)

*Further investigation:*
- Please help to test with other versions of ArcGIS.
- I did not test the functionality of the application, whether it still works as expected.
- I am not sure if it violates ESRI's Term.
